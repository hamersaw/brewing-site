Being born and raised in Wisconsin we were intimately familiar with the domestic scene. Where it's common to slog through double digit beverages in a night and the cheaper the better. It wasn't until we moved to Fort Collins, Colorado where we began to appreciate craft brews. Whether a construct of the relatively somber drinking scene, or an improvement in our general maturity is up for debate.

Fort Collins is the city responsible for the largest distribution of beer in Colorado, and Colorado is the largest distributor state-wise in the US. It's home to (as of 2019-09-10) 24 breweries, which is impressive given the 160k population. Perhaps the most well known is New Belgium, home of the Fat Tire. Some specialize in cask, barrel-aged, or sour styles while others focus on regions like Germany or Belgium. Also, Colorado is home to some fantastic beer festivals, drawing in hundreds of of the top breweries internationally. To put it simply -- if you like beer, there's something for you here.

After being enthralled with the craft brewery scene, a logical next step is to try your hand at home brewing. I believe this is the subsidiary, more attainable "let's buy a bar" goal applied to my generation. Armed with a collection of stainless kitchen pots and our stout resolution we began cooking up some wicked concauctions. I've powered through some pretty awful beer in my day; skunky, warm, you name it, but I have to shamefully admit I poured out my first home brew. A terrible IPA that tasted eerily simlar to shame and despair. In these things I've learned rock bottom is usually the best place to start.

Since that fateful evening I've brewed regularily, honing my craft by reading books, talking to successful brewers, and gaining general experience. I've brewed a variety of different styles, creating unique recipes that put my Wisconsin twist on classic styles. With each batch I learn something new; a better technique, an ingrediant with specific properties, and much more. For me, I think it comes down to that great feeling of accomplishment in designing and creating something new.

Ultimately, the end goal is to open a successful brewery. I think Wisconsin, and the Fox Valley in particular, is primed for the craft beer scene. Home to arguably the most devoted beer drinking population, but lacking access to creative brews. As any worthy endevour, this is a long process and we are currently at the stage of "let's see what happens". We appreciate your interest in our story and hope you will follow the winding, but delicious and mildly carbonated path we take.
