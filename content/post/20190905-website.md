Powered by the Hugo project we have designed and launched this website. The home page will manifest general "Updates", relatively tracking our percieved progress. Also included is a short "About Us" section outlining our roots. And finally a tab for "Beers", where we have highlighted what we envision as our Flagship beer line. This includes a short description of each offering.

Our goal in this is just to get our name out. Having an anchor for reference, contact info, etc is paramount during this process. A primary goal is going to be feedback. I'm currently working on some variant of a sane portal to handle this. Obviously, we are interested in what you think of our beers, and what you want to see.

As new, big things happen for us I will make sure to post updates here. I'm thinking along the lines of "did pretty well at a homebrew competition", "built a new brewing setup", or "tried out a new style, here's our thoughts". Who knows, this could be a fantastic medium, a huge success providing captivating material. More likely, it will be filled with general debauchery, only time will tell!
