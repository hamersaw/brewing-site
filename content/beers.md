## Porch Day - Belgian Wit
In college, we designated one day each summer to gathering on a porch, procuring a beer keg, and solving the worlds problems. An ode to this time honored tradition, Porch Day aims to be the perfect "kick back on a sunny day" drink. You will find a light, fluffy body and citrus notes in this easy drinking, traditional Belgian style beer.

Pairs well with: A lake view, "Freebird" by Lynyrd Skynyrd

## Aggie - Irish Red
Brewed as a traditional Irish Red, we focus on popular European malts and hops. Our grain bill produces a crisp, medium bodied beer with notes of carmel, toffee, and slight roasted flavors. Devout in it's adherence to the classic Irish brewing style, this beer exemplifies the loyalty found only in mans best friend.

Pairs well with: Long handled mustaches, potato famines

## Back Country - Black Ale
This brew embodies the chocolate and roasted flavors common in dark beers. However, it's crisp and light bodied, contradicting the "heavy" characteristic of stouts / porters. TODO

Pairs well with: That awkward teenage phase, a nice pair of slacks

## NCNS (No Cream, No Sugar, Just Beer!) - Coffee Pale Ale

Pairs well with: Untamed optimism, large framed reading glasses

## Brewshido - Rye IPA
"Live for the hop, fight for the hop, die for the hop"

A play on the Samurai code -- Bushido, this stalwart IPA is unwavering in it's devotion to the hop. The heavy use of dry-hopped Warrior and Simcoe provide a deep, earthy, and herbal bitterness which is balanced with spicy rye flavors.

Pairs well with: A well-timed calvalry charge, people who rub dirt on their wounds

## Hamersaw - Double IPA

Pairs well with: a face-shredding guitar solo
